# 🔹 TOPIC 1: Python Program Structure
# 🔍 Key Concepts

# Python runs top to bottom

# Every script is a sequence of instructions

# Whitespace & indentation matter

# Example:-
print("Script started")
print("Script running...")
print("Script fininshed")

# Explanation:-
# 1. The first line prints "Script started" to the console.
# 2. The second line prints "Script running..." to the console.
# 3. The third line prints "Script finished" to the console.
# Python executes each line in order, from top to bottom.       
# Indentation is crucial in Python as it defines code blocks. For example, in functions, loops, and conditionals.
# Proper indentation ensures that the code runs correctly and is easy to read.
# In summary, understanding the structure of a Python program is essential for writing clear and effective code
# Practice Exercise:
# Write a simple Python script that prints the following lines in order:
# 1. "Hello, World!"
# 2. "Welcome to Python Programming"
# 3. "Let's learn together!"    
print("Hello, World!")
print("Welcome to Python Programming")
print("Let's learn together!")
# This exercise helps reinforce the concept of program structure and the importance of line-by-line execution in Python.
