# 🧠 HOW THIS TRAINING WILL WORK (PROFESSIONAL STYLE)

✔ Start from **absolute basics**
✔ Heavy focus on **logic building**
✔ **15+ exercises per topic**, increasing difficulty
✔ Exercises include **real DevOps production scenarios**
✔ You code → you confirm → we proceed
✔ I review mistakes and explain **why**, not just **what**

This is **how senior DevOps engineers train juniors in real teams**.

# 📅 DAY 1 (RESTARTED PROPERLY):

## Python Fundamentals – Thinking Like an Automation Engineer

### 🎯 DAY 1 GOAL

By the end of today, you will:

* Think in **variables and logic**
* Understand how scripts execute line-by-line
* Be comfortable writing **very small but correct scripts**
* Build confidence before touching advanced topics

---

## 🔹 TOPIC 1: Python Program Structure

### 🔍 Key Concepts

* Python runs **top to bottom**
* Every script is a **sequence of instructions**
* Whitespace & indentation matter

### Example:

```python
print("Script started")
print("Script running")
print("Script finished")
```

---

## 🔹 TOPIC 2: Variables (CORE OF LOGIC)

### 🔍 What professionals do:

Variables represent:

* server names
* IPs
* file paths
* counts
* flags (True/False)

```python
server_name = "web-01"
uptime_days = 12
is_running = True
```

---

## 🔹 TOPIC 3: Data Types (ABSOLUTE MUST)

| Type  | Example   | DevOps Use    |
| ----- | --------- | ------------- |
| str   | `"nginx"` | service names |
| int   | `5`       | retry count   |
| float | `75.5`    | CPU usage     |
| bool  | `True`    | health checks |

Check type:

```python
print(type(server_name))
```

---

## 🔹 TOPIC 4: Printing & Reading Input

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(f"Welcome {name}")
```

---

# 🧪 DAY 1 PRACTICE – **20 EXERCISES**

⚠️ **You MUST write scripts for each. No shortcuts.**

---

## 🟢 LEVEL 1 – BASIC LOGIC (1–7)

1. Create a script that prints your name and role as "DevOps Engineer".
2. Store a server name in a variable and print it.
3. Store CPU usage as a number and print it.
4. Print the data type of:

   * a string
   * an integer
5. Take user input for username and print a welcome message.
6. Store today’s task (string) and print it.
7. Store `True` in a variable called `server_up` and print it.

---

## 🟡 LEVEL 2 – REAL DEVOPS CONTEXT (8–14)

8. Store:

   * hostname
   * IP address
     Print them in one line.
9. Store disk usage percentage and print:

   ```
   Disk usage is 70%
   ```
10. Store number of running containers and print it.
11. Ask user for environment name (dev/prod) and print it.
12. Store log file path and print it.
13. Store backup status (`True` or `False`) and print it.
14. Store retry count and print:

```
Retry attempt: 3
```

---

## 🔵 LEVEL 3 – THINK LIKE A SCRIPT (15–20)

15. Take user input for server name and print:

```
Checking server: <server_name>
```

16. Store service name and its status and print both.
17. Store memory usage as float and print it.
18. Print a formatted message using **f-string** with 3 variables.
19. Print a startup message:

```
Automation Script Started
```

20. Print an end message:

```
Automation Script Completed Successfully
```

---

# ❌ COMMON BEGINNER MISTAKES (READ CAREFULLY)

❌ Using variables before assigning them
❌ Mixing strings and numbers without formatting
❌ Forgetting `f` in f-strings
❌ Wrong indentation
❌ Copy-pasting without understanding

---

# 🧠 HOW PROFESSIONALS PRACTICE (VERY IMPORTANT)

Senior DevOps engineers:

* Write **tiny scripts daily**
* Print everything to understand flow
* Never rush topics
* Practice same logic in multiple ways
* Debug by printing variables

You are training **exactly the same way**.
