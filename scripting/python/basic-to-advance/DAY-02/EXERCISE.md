# 🐧 DAY 2 (LINUX MODE)

## Conditions + Decisions on Ubuntu

🎯 Goal:
Make decisions based on **real system data**.

---

## 🟢 DAY 2 – LINUX PRACTICE (25 EXERCISES)

---

### 🟢 LEVEL 1 – BASIC CONDITIONS (1–8)

1. Check if current user is `root`.
2. Check if hostname length > 5.
3. Check if `/etc/passwd` file exists.
4. Check if `/tmp` directory exists.
5. Check if Python version is 3.
6. Check if system uptime > 1 hour.
7. Check if disk usage command runs successfully.
8. Print message if command output is empty.

---

### 🟡 LEVEL 2 – DEVOPS CONDITIONS (9–17)

9. Alert if disk usage > 80%.
10. Alert if memory usage > 70%.
11. Check if `ssh` service is running.
12. Check if `cron` service is active.
13. Skip deployment if OS is not Ubuntu.
14. Alert if `/var/log/syslog` contains `"error"`.
15. Restart service if inactive (print only).
16. Block script if user is not root.
17. Print success if command exit code is 0.

---

### 🔵 LEVEL 3 – PRODUCTION LOGIC (18–25)

18. Decide backup based on day (Linux date).
19. Check multiple services at once.
20. Alert if any service is down.
21. Decide scaling based on CPU load.
22. Stop script if disk is full.
23. Confirm user input before action.
24. Combine multiple conditions.
25. Print final system health status.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT SAFETY NOTE

🚫 Do **NOT** run destructive commands
✔ Read-only commands only
✔ Print instead of execute restarts

---

## 🧠 WHY THIS MATTERS (REALITY)

Real DevOps engineers:

* Don’t practice fake variables
* Use **actual system data**
* Write scripts that **observe → decide → act**

You are now training **exactly like that**.

---

## ✅ HOW TO USE THIS

You can:

* Practice these alongside Day 3
* Strengthen fundamentals deeply
* Re-run them anytime
